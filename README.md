# Predicting Labor Market Trends

## Overview

A group project aiming to use U.S. County-level census data and machine learning techniques to predict labor market trends such as unemployment rates, job growth, and vulnerable-worker disparities.

## Team Members

- Khoa Cao (kcao@bu.edu)
- John Kim (jjk29@bu.edu)
- Laurel Purcell (lgp116@bu.edu)
- Patty Huang (pattyh@bu.edu)

## Objectives

- Analyze U.S. County-level census data to identify patterns and trends in the labor market.
- Develop machine learning models to predict key labor market indicators.
- Provide insights into vulnerable-worker disparities and job growth opportunities.
- Share findings and methodologies through a comprehensive report.

## Data Sources

The project's dataset will be compiled from various public sources at the county-level in the U.S. The time frame for the data will be from 2010 to the most recent available year (2024).

- [U.S. Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/)
- [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/)
- [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
- Other relevant public datasets

## Data Visualization

- Use time series plots to visualize trends
- Use heatmaps to show geographic disparities
- Use bar charts to compare different demographic groups
- Use scatter plots to show correlations between variables (e.g., education level vs. unemployment rate, GDP growth vs. job growth)

## Machine Learning Techniques

- Regression analysis (e.g., linear regression) with regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
- Decision trees and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Clustering
- Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM for time series data)

## Test Plan

We will likely use a combination of the following methods to evaluate our models:

- Train-test split (10% of data reserved for testing)
- Cross-validation
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., Root MSE, MAE, R-squared for regression tasks)
